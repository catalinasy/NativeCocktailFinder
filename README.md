This application relies on React Native and Redux (for state management). 
It allows you to search for drinks over a Cocktail API.

### Third-Party Libraries:

To achieve functionality and a nice UI I used the following libraries:
 - react-native-linear-gradient: to create the linear gradients on the screens
 - axios: to manage the requests to the API
 - react-navigation, react-native-gesture-handler and react-navigation-stack: to achive navigation between screens
 

### State architecture:
state
format function
actions

### Getting Started

1) Clone this repo 
2) Exec npm install 

To run locally you would need to install an Emulator for Android. (https://developer.android.com/studio)
To run in iOS you need a OSX.

4) For iOS: Exec npm run ios 
5) For Android: Open the android emulator first (!!) and after that exec npm run android

Usage

The UI is very intuitive, enter the name of a Cocktail drink you would like to search for and enjoy ❤️
